Who/what is the "lovely_class"? 
We are a prestige team of up and coming developers learning and working within the triOS College organization.
A group of 18 diverse individuals from different backgrounds, all working towards one common goal.
Eventually fixing the bugs in Microsoft Teams. 
These bugs test the patience of our coding master on a daily basis! 
These must be debugged!
